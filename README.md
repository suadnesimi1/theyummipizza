I simply tried to create a pizza order application with reactjs.
The usage this application is, first we do the registration. And login with mail and password to complete our order.
Then we can simply execute our order by selecting the type, shape of the pizza and the address, and then press the confirm order button.
When we press the confirm order button, the data is saved on the dashboard. To view the data in the Dashboard we can enter as admin: 


@username:admin@gmail.com, 
@password: password
